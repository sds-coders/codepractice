#### File and directory naming conventions for collaborative coding practice 
#### 협업 코딩을 위한 파일 명명 규칙 제안
1. For a file, include the page number, exercise # or a name, and the programmer initials within the file name. 

   If an exercise has an exercise #, including the exercise # should be preferred to including the exercise name.
   
   It is encouraged that exercise name should only be included when no exercise # is provided.
   
   A file should include a solution to only one coding exercise at a time.

   Below is a suggested format for a file name.

   > `[ Page Number ]_[ Exercise # or a name ]_[ Programmer Initials][ File Extension ]`

2. Directory should be created when starting a new chapter or a topic

   Directory name should contain the starting page of the chapter or a topic in order to maintain the order of topics listed within the book.
   
   Below is a suggested format for a directory name.
   
   > `[ Page Number ]_[ Chapter Name ]`

3. Below Lists some examples of a file and directory names.
   
   When an exercise does have an exercise #:
   ```
   1_1_yjinleegh.py
   151_3_yjinleegh.py
   ```
   
   When an exercise does have a name but does not have an exercise #:
   ```
   1_BinarySearchTree_yjinleegh.py
   151_Multiplication_yjinleegh.py
   131_계산기_yjinleegh.py
   ```
   
   Example of a directory name:
   ```
   15_Inputs
   257_Threads
   ```
